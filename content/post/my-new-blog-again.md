Earlier this year I moved my blog to Jekyll.  It was fun while it lasted. I've decided to give Hugo a try.  The main reason is that I wanted something I could easily from either my Windows or Mac machines. I didn't want to mess with installing or configuring Ruby gems.

I'm giving Hugo a try.  I expect to change the theme and make tweaks over the coming weeks.
