Welcome to my new blog! I've decided to try an experiment and change my personal blog from Wordpress.com to Jekyll with GitHub Pages. I'll keep my old blog at [https://michaelcollier.wordpress.com](https://michaelcollier.wordpress.com) around, but will (assuming this experiment works out) not be posting more there.
