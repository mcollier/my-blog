Earlier this month I had the pleasure to join [The Azure Podcast](http://azpodcast.azurewebsites.net/post/Episode-364-Virtual-Networking-with-Functions) team to talk about my experiences with Azure Functions.  We discussed how I came to love working with Azure, my journey from classic Cloud Services to Azure Functions, and the current state of virtual networking with Azure Functions.

This was my second time on the podcast.  My [first appearance](http://azpodcast.azurewebsites.net/post/Episode-68-Fundmentals-of-Azure-Book) was a little more than 5 years ago after the release of a book I co-authored, _Fundamentals of Azure_.  

I really enjoyed discussing Azure Functions with the podcast's hosts.  Hopefully it isn't 5 years before I join the show again.  :smiley:
