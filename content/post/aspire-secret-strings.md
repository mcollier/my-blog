If you're building modern .NET Aspire apps, you're probably familiar with how service names and resource identifiers are often passed around as string literals, things like `"apiservice"` or `"storage"`. But these **magic strings** can lead to headaches: typos, duplication, poor discoverability, and painful refactoring.

Thankfully, there's a clean and safe way to centralize and manage these identifiers using a shared constants class, **removing "secret strings" from your Aspire project.** :boom:

## :sparkles: Credit Where Credit’s Due

First, big thanks to [Jeff Fritz](https://www.youtube.com/@csharpfritz) for showcasing this pattern in his excellent video: [“Organize your .NET Aspire Projects like a Pro!”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt39GzYCRgo). I also saw Jeff share this approach during his [excellent talk at StirTrek](https://youtu.be/wHX9we3Vx64?si=B6gwD_YVyPVrIKgB) earlier this year. This post builds directly on that idea and shows how you can apply it to both project references and cloud resources like Azure Storage.

## :dart: The Problem: Magic Strings in AppHost.cs

Here’s what the typical Aspire AppHost.cs might look like:

```csharp
var apiService = builder.AddProject<Projects.AgentFunction_ApiService>("apiservice");
```

Or when registering Azure Storage resources:

```csharp
var storage = builder.AddAzureStorage("storage")
                     .RunAsEmulator();
var blobs = storage.AddBlobs("blobs");
var queues = storage.AddQueues("queues");
```

These string literals (`"apiservice"`, `"storage"`, `"blobs"`, etc.) are fragile and hard to reuse safely across your codebase.

> One minor typo and things don't work and you're left scratching your head for a while, only to later realize you can't spell. Been there. :unamused:

## :wrench: Step 1: Create a New Shared Project

Create a new class library in your solution:

```bash
dotnet new classlib -n Shared
```

This project will house your service and resource names.

## :computer: Step 2: Define Constants in Shared/Services.cs

Create a static class in the Shared project:

```csharp
namespace Shared;

public static class Services
{
    public const string ApiService = "apiservice";
    public const string AzureStorage = "storage";
    public const string AzureStorageBlobs = "blobs";
    public const string AzureStorageQueues = "queues";
}
```

Now you have a single source of truth for all your Aspire identifiers. :dart:

## :link: Step 3: Reference Shared from AppHost

Edit the `AppHost.csproj` to include a reference to `Shared`, but be sure to opt out of Aspire’s resource detection using the `IsAspireProjectResource="false"` attribute:

```xml
<ProjectReference Include="..\Shared\Shared.csproj" IsAspireProjectResource="false" />
```

This ensures Aspire doesn't treat `Shared` as a resource provider.

## :hammer: Step 4: Update AppHost.cs to Use Constants

Now refactor your code to use those constants:

### :hourglass_flowing_sand: Old

```csharp
var apiService = builder.AddProject<Projects.AgentFunction_ApiService>("apiservice");
```

### :white_check_mark: New

```csharp
var apiService = builder.AddProject<Projects.ApiService>(Shared.Services.ApiService);
```

And for Azure Storage:

### :hourglass_flowing_sand: Old

```csharp
var storage = builder.AddAzureStorage("storage")
                     .RunAsEmulator();
var blobs = storage.AddBlobs("blobs");
var queues = storage.AddQueues("queues");

```

### :white_check_mark: New

```csharp
var storage = builder.AddAzureStorage(Shared.Services.AzureStorage)
                     .RunAsEmulator();
var blobs = storage.AddBlobs(Shared.Services.AzureStorageBlobs);
var queues = storage.AddQueues(Shared.Services.AzureStorageQueues);
```

Cleaner. Safer. Easier to manage. :bulb:

## :balloon: Step 5: Reference Shared in Client Projects (Optional)

If you have other Aspire projects (e.g., frontend apps or background workers) that also use these service names, add a project reference to `Shared` there as well.

And the code then becomes:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureQueueServiceClient(Services.AzureStorageQueues);
```

Now your whole solution can rely on centralized, strongly-typed service identifiers.

## :bell: Bonus: Shorten Project Names

In addition to removing magic strings, you can simplify long project names in Aspire by explicitly specifying the `AspireProjectMetadataTypeName` metadata type name in your project reference.

### :hourglass_flowing_sand: Old

```xml
<ProjectReference Include="..\AgentFunction.ApiService\AgentFunction.ApiService.csproj" />
```

This results in awkward long names like:

```csharp
builder.AddProject<Projects.AgentFunction_ApiService>("apiservice");
```

### :white_check_mark: New

```xml
<ProjectReference Include="..\AgentFunction.ApiService\AgentFunction.ApiService.csproj"
                  AspireProjectMetadataTypeName="ApiService" />
```

Now you can shorten the reference in AppHost.cs to:

```csharp
builder.AddProject<Projects.ApiService>(Shared.Services.ApiService);
```

This makes your code cleaner and more readable, especially in solutions with deeply nested or namespaced projects.
